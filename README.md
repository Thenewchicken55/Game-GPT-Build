# Game-GPT-Build
Game-GPT source code is currently private. However, this repository grants access to the executable.
This project implements AI into Unity in an effort to show how games could improve NPC dialogues.

 - Fix lag by making HTTP request non-blocking.
 - Improve overall user experience
 - Add text-to-speech and speech-to-text
 - Fix NPC's to idle in accordance with their speech (i.e. NPC should not start jogging while talking)
